# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera
Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Project Assignment

##R script:

The script [`run_analysis.R`](run_analysis.R) does the following actions:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The result of this script is: [`tidyData.txt`](tidyData.txt)

N.B. As per the project directions, the unzipped data is to be present in the working directory

##Code Book:
The [`codebook`](CodeBook.md) describes the variables and elaborates the transformations
